The Smart Campus Meal Planner is a web-based tool that allows students to schedule their meals using real-time dining hall menus. Students can choose from the options displayed on campus dining menus to plan their meals in advance.
     Our motivation behind this project is simple: balancing time management with regular and healthy eating habits can be difficult as a college student.
     The primary users of this system are college students who rely on campus meal plans, while secondary stakeholders include campus dining staff who can benefit from insights into student preferences and demand trends.
